# How to Build

## Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you need the following tools and dependencies installed:

### 1. **Rust**
- Install Rust using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- After installation, add the **Nightly toolchain** with the Cranelift backend:
  ```bash
  rustup install nightly
  rustup default nightly
  rustup component add rustc-codegen-cranelift-preview --toolchain nightly
  ```

### 2. **Just**
- **Just** is used in this project to manage build. Install it using Cargo:
  ```bash
  cargo install just
  ```
> Note: You can also install Just using your system's package manager.

### 3. **Dependencies**

Install the required dependencies based on your operating system:

#### Arch Linux
```bash
sudo pacman -S base-devel mold clang vulkan-radeon vulkan-tools
```
- Replace `vulkan-radeon` with:   
  - `vulkan-intel` for Intel GPUs.   
  - `nvidia-utils` for NVIDIA GPUs.   

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y \
    build-essential mold clang mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools
```
- For NVIDIA GPUs, also install:
    ```shell
    sudo apt install -y nvidia-driver nvidia-vulkan-icd
    ```

#### Windows
- **Git Bash** is required to ensure the commands in the `Justfile` and scripts run correctly. Download and install [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/).
- After installation, make sure Git Bash is added to your system's `PATH`. You can verify it by running:
  ```bash
  bash --version
  ```

## Running the Project

To compile and run the game locally, use the following commands:

Note: the first compilation will be slow depending on your hardware, next compilations will be incremental and thus faster.

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/c2i-junia/minecraft-rust

# Navigate to the project directory
cd minecraft-rust
```

Debug mode:
```sh
./run-server.sh  # this will compile the project and run the server
./run1.sh        # this will compile the project and run the client 
```

Release mode:
```sh
# Build the project in debug or release mode
just generate-release-folder

# Run the executable
./release/bin/rustcraft         # run the client
./release/bin/rustcraft-server  # run the server
```

## Guidelines 

### Format
Run `cargo fmt` before committing.

### Commit messages:

We follow the [Conventional Commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Our commit types are inspired by the [Karma specification](http://karma-runner.github.io/6.4/dev/git-commit-msg.html)

Allowed <type> values: 
- **feat** for a new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a MINOR version.
- **fix** for a bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version.
- **perf** for performance improvements. Such commit will trigger a release bumping a PATCH version.
- **docs** for changes to the documentation.
- **style** for formatting changes, missing semicolons, etc.
- **refactor** for refactoring production code, e.g. renaming a variable.
- **test** for adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change.
- **build** for updating build configuration, development tools or other changes irrelevant to the user.

Write commit messages in the present tense (e.g., "Add feature X" instead of "Added feature X").

If a commit is co-authored by multiple people, do not hesitate to add a `Co-authored-by` field. See [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors). For example: 
```sh
$ git commit -m "Refactor usability tests.
>
>
Co-authored-by: NAME <NAME@EXAMPLE.COM>
Co-authored-by: ANOTHER-NAME <ANOTHER-NAME@EXAMPLE.COM>"
```

### Branches
- Use the naming convention `<type>/<name>` for branches introducing new features. Only use lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes.
- The `main` branch should always compile successfully and be free of warnings. Use `cargo check`.
- Experimental branches are allowed to include code that does not build successfully.
- Prefer rebasing over merging.
